# Snake-Water-Game
Snake Water Gun is a fun and simple hand game similar to Rock Paper Scissors. This project is an implementation of the game in Python, allowing users to play against the computer. The game follows straightforward rules where each of the three elements (Snake, Water, Gun) interacts uniquely with the others.
